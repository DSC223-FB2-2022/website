But you should clean up some of the narrative so that it only includes what you want to turn in.\n\nFirst let's plot the data in the dino dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](lab-01_files/figure-html/plot-dino-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndino_data %>%\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n        r\n    <dbl>\n1 -0.0645\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 3\n\nAdd code and narrative as needed. Note that the R chunks are labelled with `plot-star` and `cor-star` to provide spaces to place the code for plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient. To finish, clean up the narrative by removing these instructions.\n\nBlah blah blah...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nI'm some text, you should replace me with more meaningful text...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 4\n\nAdd code and narrative as needed. Note that two R chunks are given but they are not labeled. Use the convention from above to name them appropriately.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Exercise 5\n\nAdd code and narrative as needed. To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.\n",
