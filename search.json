    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables.

Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed.

This course supports the Educational Priorities and Outcomes of Cornell College with emphasis on knowledge, inquiry, reasoning, and communication, ethical behavior, citizenship, and vocation. Your emphasis on knowledge is in the skills you will learn and apply in various interdisciplinary fields. You will inquire when investigating data – seeing patters or trends and exploring them to. Your reasoning skills are built and tested when making decisions based on the data and your own programmed visualizations and numerical summaries. Your group work in class and group project presentations will help you practice your communication of statistical analysis. When you make decisions about what data to work with, how to treat the data, and how to talk about your results in an ethical way you practice good ethical behavior. Some of our analysis’ will be with data from institutions such as governments or organizations that have an influence on the public – these types of analysis’ can inform public policies and are our way, as data scientists, to practice citizenship. Lastly, you will learn about the field of data science and the types of knowledge and training that would be required to support your vocation as a data scientist."

The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES!

This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %>%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

    "text": "Instructional staff employment trends\nThe American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a nonprofit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals. This report compiled by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains an image very similar to the one given below.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start by loading the data used to create this plot.\n\nstaff <- read_csv(\"data/instructional-staff.csv\")\n\nEach row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the years for which we have data. The values are percentage of hires of that type of faculty for each year.\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 12\n  facult…¹ `1975` `1989` `1993` `1995` `1999` `2001` `2003` `2005` `2007` `2009`\n  <chr>     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 Full-Ti…   29     27.6   25     24.8   21.8   20.3   19.3   17.8   17.2   16.8\n2 Full-Ti…   16.1   11.4   10.2    9.6    8.9    9.2    8.8    8.2    8      7.6\n3 Full-Ti…   10.3   14.1   13.6   13.6   15.2   15.5   15     14.8   14.9   15.1\n4 Part-Ti…   24     30.4   33.1   33.2   35.5   36     37     39.3   40.5   41.1\n5 Graduat…   20.5   16.5   18.1   18.8   18.7   19     20     19.9   19.5   19.4\n# … with 1 more variable: `2011` <dbl>, and abbreviated variable name\n#   ¹​faculty_type\n\n\nIn order to recreate this visualization we need to first reshape the data to have one variable for faculty type and one variable for year. In other words, we will convert the data from wide format to long format.\nBut before we do so, a thought exercise: How many rows will the long-format data have? It will have a row for each combination of year and faculty type. If there are 5 faculty types and 11 years of data, how many rows will we have?\nWe do the wide to long conversion using a new function: pivot_longer(). The animation below show how this function works, as well as its counterpart pivot_wider().\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function has the following arguments:\n\npivot_longer(data, cols, names_to = \"name\")\n\n\nThe first argument is data as usual.\nThe second argument, cols, is where you specify which columns to pivot into longer format – in this case all columns except for the faculty_type\nThe third argument, names_to, is a string specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in the column names of data – in this case year\n\n\nstaff_long <- staff %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = \"year\") %>%\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))\n\nLet’s take a look at what the new longer data frame looks like.\n\nstaff_long\n\n# A tibble: 55 × 3\n   faculty_type               year value\n   <chr>                     <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1975  29  \n 2 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1989  27.6\n 3 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1993  25  \n 4 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1995  24.8\n 5 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1999  21.8\n 6 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2001  20.3\n 7 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2003  19.3\n 8 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2005  17.8\n 9 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2007  17.2\n10 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2009  16.8\n# … with 45 more rows\n\n\nAnd now let’s plot is as a line plot. A possible approach for creating a line plot where we color the lines by faculty type is the following:\n\nstaff_long %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = faculty_type)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\nBut note that this results in a message as well as an unexpected plot. The message is saying that there is only one observation for each faculty type year combination. We can fix this using the group aesthetic following.\n\nstaff_long %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, group = faculty_type, color = faculty_type)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude the line plot you made above in your report and make sure the figure width is large enough to make it legible. Also fix the title, axis labels, and legend label.\nSuppose the objective of this plot was to show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types. What changes would you propose making to this plot to tell this story and why.\nImplement the changes you proposed in the previous exercise.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards."

    "text": "Have you ever taken a road trip in the US and thought to yourself “I wonder what La Quinta means”. Well, the late comedian Mitch Hedberg thinks it’s Spanish for next to Denny’s.\nIf you’re not familiar with these two establishments, Denny’s is a casual diner chain that is open 24 hours and La Quinta Inn and Suites is a hotel chain.\nThese two establishments tend to be clustered together, or at least this observation is a joke made famous by Mitch Hedberg. In this lab we explore the validity of this joke and along the way learn some more data wrangling and tips for visualizing spatial data.\nThe inspiration for this lab comes from a blog post by John Reiser on his new jersey geographer blog. You can read that analysis here. Reiser’s blog post focuses on scraping data from Denny’s and La Quinta Inn and Suites websites using Python. In this lab we focus on visualization and analysis of these data. However note that the data scraping was also done in R, and we we will discuss web scraping using R later in the course. But for now we focus on the data that has already been scraped and tidied for you."

    "text": "R is the name of the programming language itself and RStudio is a convenient interface.\nThe main goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio, which we will be using throughout the course both to learn the statistical concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.\nAn additional goal is to introduce you to Git and GitHub, which is the collaboration and version control system that we will be using throughout the course.\nAs the labs progress, you are encouraged to explore beyond what the labs dictate; a willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands.\nAnd to make versioning simpler, this is a solo lab. Additionally, we want to make sure everyone gets a significant amount of time at the steering wheel. In future labs you’ll learn about collaborating on GitHub and produce a single lab report for your team."

    "text": "Warm up\nBefore we introduce the data, let’s warm up with some simple exercises.\n\nThe top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for \"YAML Ain't Markup Language\". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n\nYAML\nOpen the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nGo to the Git pane in your RStudio (top right) and click on Commit. This will bring up a new menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have made changes to your Rmd file (which you just changed your name), you should see it list on of the left. Diff shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state that includes your changes. Look over the files in the box that say they have been change. If agree with these changes, you will need to check the box to the left of each changed file, and in this case, write “Update author name” in the Commit message box. Then click Commit. It is important that you always describe what changes were made since your last commit in that box. This is how people in your team know what you changed without having to review thousands of lines of code.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome. You should consider committing states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration. In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the block progresses we will let you make these decisions. Committing does not save your progress to the web.\n\n\nPushing changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to the web! Or more specifically, to your repo on GitHub. Why? So that others can see your changes. And by others, we mean whoever you are working with.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, click on Push. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password, then your PAT. This might feel cumbersome. Bear with me… We will teach you how to save your password so you don’t have to enter it every time. But for this one assignment you’ll have to manually enter each time you push in order to gain some experience with it."

    "text": "Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. The article titled, “Beauty in the classroom: instructors’ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity” (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings. (Daniel S. Hamermesh, Amy Parker, Beauty in the classroom: instructors pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity, Economics of Education Review, Volume 24, Issue 4, August 2005, Pages 369-376, ISSN 0272-7757, 10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.07.013. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165.)\nIn this lab you will analyze the data from this study in order to learn what goes into a positive professor evaluation.\nThe data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six students rated the professors’ physical appearance. (This is a slightly modified version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication data for Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Gelman and Hill, 2007).) The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about the courses and professors."

We can extract this information using a new function from the rvest package, html_attr(), which extracts attributes.\nA mini HTML lesson! The following is how we define hyperlinked text in HTML:\n<a href=\"https://www.google.com\">Seach on Google</a>\nAnd this is how the text would look like on a webpage: Seach on Google.\nHere the text is Seach on Google and the href attribute contains the url of the website you’d go to if you click on the hyperlinked text: https://www.google.com.\nThe moral of the story is: the link is stored in the href attribute.\n\npage %>%\n  html_nodes(\".iteminfo\") %>%   # same nodes\n  html_node(\"h3 a\") %>%         # as before\n  html_attr(\"href\")             # but get href attribute instead of text\n\n [1] \"./record/50523?highlight=*:*\" \"./record/21172?highlight=*:*\"\n [3] \"./record/21876?highlight=*:*\" \"./record/21407?highlight=*:*\"\n [5] \"./record/22497?highlight=*:*\" \"./record/22657?highlight=*:*\"\n [7] \"./record/21960?highlight=*:*\" \"./record/21134?highlight=*:*\"\n [9] \"./record/21746?highlight=*:*\" \"./record/53782?highlight=*:*\"\n\n\nThese don’t really look like URLs as we know then though. They’re relative links.\n\nSee the help for `str_replace()` to find out how it works. Remember that the first argument is passed in from the pipeline, so you just need to define the `pattern` and `replacement` arguments.\n\n\nClick on one of art piece titles in your browser and take note of the url of the webpage it takes you to. Think about how that url compares to what we scraped above? How is it different? Using str_replace(), fix the URLs. You’ll note something special happening in the pattern to replace. We want to replace the ., but we have it as \\\\.. This is because the period . is a special character and so we need to escape it first with backslashes, \\\\s.\n\n\n\nArtists\n\nFill in the blanks to scrape artist names.\n\n\n\nPut it altogether\n\nFill in the blanks to organize everything in a tibble.\n\n\n\nScrape the next page\n\nClick on the next page, and grab its url. Fill in the blank in to define a new object: second_url. Copy-paste code from top of the R script to scrape the new set of art pieces, and save the resulting data frame as second_ten.\n\n✅ ⬆️ If you haven’t done so recently, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

    "text": "Iteration\n\nWork in scripts/03-scrape-page-many.R.\n\nWe went from manually scraping individual pages to writing a function to do the same. Next, we will work on making our workflow a little more efficient by using R to iterate over all pages that contain information on the art collection.\n\n**Reminder:** The collection has 2970 pieces in total.\n\nThat means we give develop a list of URLs (of pages that each have 10 art pieces), and write some code that applies the scrape_page() function to each page, and combines the resulting data frames from each page into a single data frame with 2970 rows and 3 columns.\n\nList of URLs\nClick through the first few of the pages in the art collection and observe their URLs to confirm the following pattern:\n[sometext]offset=0     # Pieces 1-10\n[sometext]offset=10    # Pieces 11-20\n[sometext]offset=20    # Pieces 21-30\n[sometext]offset=30    # Pieces 31-40\n...\n[sometext]offset=2960  # Pieces 2961-2970\nWe can construct these URLs in R by pasting together two pieces: (1) a common (root) text for the beginning of the URL, and (2) numbers starting at 0, increasing by 10, all the way up to 2970. Two new functions are helpful for accomplishing this: glue() for pasting two pieces of text and seq() for generating a sequence of numbers.\n\nFill in the blanks to construct the list of URLs.\n\n\n\nMapping\nFinally, we’re ready to iterate over the list of URLs we constructed. We will do this by mapping the function we developed over the list of URLs. There are a series of mapping functions in R (which we’ll learn about in more detail tomorrow), and they each take the following form:\nmap([x], [function to apply to each element of x])\nIn our case x is the list of URLs we constructed and the function to apply to each element of x is the function we developed earlier, scrape_page. And as a result we want a data frame, so we use map_dfr function:\n\nmap_dfr(urls, scrape_page)\n\n\nFill in the blanks to scrape all pages, and to create a new data frame called uoe_art.\n\n\n\nWrite out data\n\nFinally write out the data frame you constructed into the data folder so that you can use it in the analysis section.\n\n\nAim to make it to this point during the workshop.\n\n✅ ⬆️ If you haven’t done so recently, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Some of these are years, others are more specific dates, some art pieces have no date information whatsoever, and others have some non-date information in parentheses. This should be interesting to clean up!\nFirst thing we’ll try is to separate the title column into two: one for the actual title and the other for the date if it exists. In human speak, we need to\n\n“separate the title column at the first occurrence of ( and put the contents on one side of the ( into a column called title and the contents on the other side into a column called date”\n\nLuckily, there’s a function that does just this: separate()!\nAnd once we have completed separating the single title column into title and date, we need to do further clean-up in the date column to get rid of extraneous )s with str_remove(), capture year information, and save the data as a numeric variable.\n\n**Hint:** Remember escaping special characters from yesterday's lecture? You'll need to use that trick again.\n\n\nFill in the blanks in to implement the data wrangling we described above. Note that this will result in some warnings when you run the code, and that’s OK!

How many pieces have artist info missing? How many have year info missing?\nMake a histogram of years. Use a reasonable binwidth. Do you see anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\n**Hint:** You'll want to use `mutate()` and `if_else()` or `case_when()` to implement the correction.\n\n\nFind which piece has the out of the ordinary year and go to its page on the art collection website to find the correct year for it. Can you tell why our code didn’t capture the correct year information? Correct the error in the data frame and visualize the data again.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ If you haven’t done so recently, knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Any guess as to why the university has so many pieces from them?\n\n\n**Hint:** `str_subset()` can be helful here. You should consider how you might capture titles where the word appears as \"child\" and \"Child\".\n\n\nFinal question! How many art pieces have the word “child” in their title? Try to figure it out, and ask for help if you’re stuck.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Test your intuition. Using filter() determine the number of bookings in resort hotels that have more than 1 child or baby in the room? Then, do the same for city hotels, and compare the numbers of rows in the resulting filtered data frames.\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style\n\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style\n\n\n\nExercise 5.\nCreate a frequency table of the number of adults in a booking. Display the results in descending order so the most common observation is on top. What is the most common number of adults in bookings in this dataset? Are there any surprising results?\nNote: Don’t forget to label your R chunk as well (where it says label-me-1). Your label should be short, informative, and shouldn’t include spaces. It also shouldn’t repeat a previous label, otherwise R Markdown will give you an error about repeated R chunk labels.\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style\n\n\n\nExercise 6.\nRepeat Exercise 5, once for canceled bookings (is_canceled coded as 1) and once for not canceled bookings (is_canceled coded as 0). What does this reveal about the surprising results you spotted in the previous exercise?\nNote: Don’t forget to label your R chunk as well (where it says label-me-2).\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style\n\n\n\nExercise 7.\nCalculate minimum, mean, median, and maximum average daily rate (adr) grouped by hotel type so that you can get these statistics separately for resort and city hotels. Which type of hotel is higher, on average?\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style\n\n\n\nExercise 8.\nWe observe two unusual values in the summary statistics above – a negative minimum, and a very high maximum). What types of hotels are these? Locate these observations in the dataset and find out the arrival date (year and month) as well as how many people (adults, children, and babies) stayed in the room. You can investigate the data in the viewer to locate these values, but preferably you should identify them in a reproducible way with some code.\nHint: For example, you can filter for the given adr amounts and select the relevant columns.\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style"

This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset must have at least 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nIf you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class.\nBelow are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse. You’re not limited to these resources, and in fact you’re encouraged to venture beyond them. But you might find something interesting there:\n\nTidyTuesday\nNHS Scotland Open Data\nEdinburgh Open Data\nOpen access to Scotland’s official statistics\nBikeshare data portal\nUK Gov Data\nKaggle datasets\nOpenIntro datasets\nAwesome public datasets\nYouth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)\nPRISM Data Archive Project\nHarvard Dataverse\nIf you know of others, let me know, and we’ll add here…"

Then print out the output of and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of glimpse() or skim() of your data frame.\nSection 3 - Data analysis plan:\n\nThe outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.\nThe comparison groups you will use, if applicable.\nVery preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data. (You can add to these later as you work on your project.)\nThe method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s). (You can update these later as you work on your project.)\nWhat results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?\n\n\nEach section should be no more than 1 page (excluding figures). You can check a print preview to confirm length.\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows. Note that after you receive feedback for your proposal you can improve it based on the feedback and re-submit it. If you re-submit, your final score for the proposal will be the average of two scores you receive (first and second submission).\n\n\n\nTotal\n10 pts\n\n\n\n\nData\n3 pts\n\n\nProposal\n5 pts\n\n\nWorkflow, organization, code quality\n1 pt\n\n\nTeamwork\n1 pt\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation\n5 minutes maximum, and each team member should say something substantial. You can either present live during your workshop or pre-record and submit your video to be played during the workshop.\nPrepare a slide deck using the template in your repo. This template uses a package called xaringan, and allows you to make presentation slides using R Markdown syntax. There isn’t a limit to how many slides you can use, just a time limit (5 minutes total). Each team member should get a chance to speak during the presentation. Your presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried (“then we did this, then we did this, etc.”), instead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.\nBefore you finalize your presentation, make sure your chunks are turned off with echo = FALSE.\nPresentations will take place during the last workshop of the semester. You can choose to do your presentation live or pre-record it. During your workshop you will watch presentations from other teams in your workshop and provide feedback in the form of peer evaluations.

    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile)\n\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\n\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\n\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\nWe use the ggplot() function to do this. The first argument is the data frame, and the next argument gives the mapping of the variables of the data to the aesthetic elements of the plot.\nLet’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nAlong with the plot, we get a message:\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\nThis is telling us that we might want to reconsider the binwidth we chose for our histogram – or more accurately, the binwidth we didn’t specify. It’s good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth. You might ask yourself: “What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?” $1 is obviously too little, $10000 might be too high.\n\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\n\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nNow that we’ve seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.\n\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income? Use the partial code below, filling it in with the appropriate statistic and function. Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure to arrange in the correct direction.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  group_by(major_category) %>%\n  summarise(___ = ___(median)) %>%\n  arrange(___)\n\n\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample? To answer this question we use a new function called count, which first groups the data and then counts the number of observations in each category (see below). Add to the pipeline appropriately to arrange the results so that the major with the lowest observations is on top.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  count(major_category)\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

In other words, a convenient interface for writing and running R code.\nGit: A version control system.\nGitHub: A web platform for hosting version controlled files and facilitating collaboration among users.\nRepository: A Git repository contains all of your project’s files and stores each file’s revision history. It’s common to refer to a repository as a repo.\n\nIn this course, each assignment you work on will be contained in a Git repo.\nFor individual assignments, only you will have access to the repo. For team assignments, all team members will have access to a single repo where they work collaboratively.\nAll repos associated with this course are housed in the course GitHub organization. The organization is set up such that students can only see repos they have access to, but the course staff can see all of them."

Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.\nApart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.\nSource: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bike Sharing Dataset"

Then, re-order the levels in the following order: \"Agree\" and \"Not agree\". Finally, count() how many times each new level appears in the advfront variable.\n\n\nYou can do this in various ways. One option is to use the `str_detect()` function to detect the existence of words like liberal or conservative. Note that these sometimes show up with lowercase first letters and sometimes with upper case first letters. To detect either in the `str_detect()` function, you can use \"[Ll]iberal\" and \"[Cc]onservative\". But feel free to solve the problem however you like, this is just one option!\n\n\nCombine the levels of the polviews variable such that levels that have the word “liberal” in them are lumped into a level called \"Liberal\" and those that have the word conservative in them are lumped into a level called \"Conservative\". Then, re-order the levels in the following order: \"Conservative\" , \"Moderate\", and \"Liberal\". Finally, count() how many times each new level appears in the polviews variable.\nCreate a new data frame called gss16_advfront that includes the variables advfront, educ, polviews, and wrkstat. Then, use the drop_na() function to remove rows that contain NAs from this new data frame. Sample code is provided below.\n\n\ngss16_advfront <- gss16 %>%\n  select(___, ___, ___, ___) %>%\n  drop_na()\n\n\nSplit the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) data sets. Make sure to set a seed before you do the initial_split(). Call the training data gss16_train and the testing data gss16_test. Sample code is provided below.

Name this recipe gss16_rec_1. (We’ll create one more recipe later, that’s why we’re naming this recipe _1.) Sample code is provided below.\n\nstep_other() to pool values that occur less than 10% of the time (threshold = 0.10) in the wrkstat variable into \"Other\".\nstep_dummy() to create dummy variables for all_nominal() variables that are predictors, i.e. all_predictors()\n\n\n\ngss16_rec_1 <- recipe(___ ~ ___, data = ___) %>%\n  step_other(wrkstat, threshold = ___, other = \"Other\") %>%\n  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())\n\n\nSpecify a logistic regression model using \"glm\" as the engine. Name this specification gss16_spec. Sample code is provided below.\n\n\ngss16_spec <- ___() %>%\n  set_engine(\"___\")\n\n\nBuild a workflow that uses the recipe you defined (gss16_rec) and the model you specified (gss16_spec).

Sample code is provided below.\n\n\ngss16_wflow_1 <- workflow() %>%\n  add_model(___) %>%\n  add_recipe(___)\n\n\nPerform 5-fold cross validation. specifically,\n\nsplit the training data into 5 folds (don’t forget to set a seed first!),\napply the workflow you defined earlier to the folds with fit_resamples(), and\ncollect_metrics() and comment on the consistency of metrics across folds (you can get the area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for each fold by setting summarize = FALSE in collect_metrics())\nreport the average area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for all cross validation folds collect_metrics()\n\n\n\nset.seed(___)\ngss16_folds <- vfold_cv(___, v = ___)\n\ngss16_fit_rs_1 <- gss16_wflow_1 %>%\n  fit_resamples(___)\n\ncollect_metrics(___, summarize = FALSE)\ncollect_metrics(___)\n\n\nNow, try a different, simpler model: predict advfront from only polviews and educ.

Does your answer to the previous exercise hold for the testing data as well? Explain your reasoning. Note: If you haven’t yet done so, you’ll need to first train your workflows on the training data with the following, and then use these fit objects to calculate predictions for the test data.\n\n\ngss16_fit_1 <- gss16_wflow_1 %>%\n  fit(gss16_train)\n\ngss16_fit_2 <- gss16_wflow_2 %>%\n  fit(gss16_train)\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Note that the R chunks are labelled with plot-star and cor-star to provide spaces to place the code for plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient. To finish, clean up the narrative by removing these instructions.\nBlah blah blah…\n\n\n\nI’m some text, you should replace me with more meaningful text…\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nAdd code and narrative as needed. Note that two R chunks are given but they are not labeled. Use the convention from above to name them appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nAdd code and narrative as needed.

    "text": "If the status shows something other than Operational, this means there is a known incident with the containers. Check back later to see if it’s been resolved. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the course forum to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).\nEither way you can also fill out the form here, which will notify our the R TA for the department as well as our undergraduate coordinator. They’ll be able to help diagnose the issue."
