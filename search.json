    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.1.2: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Quarto CLI: https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset must have at least 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nIf you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class.\nOn the useful links part of the website you will find a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse. You’re not limited to these resources, and in fact you’re encouraged to venture beyond them."

Place your writing in an RMarkdown document in your proposal folder in your project repository. Your group will also present the data you have found. Together, as a group, we will review your idea and discuss your ideas. Every group member must contribute to this conversation. This also gives me an opportunity to help you decide if the data you have chosen will work for your questions of interest. I will be cloning you a repository to work on your project with. You do not need to copy and paste from this document.\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n10 pts\n\n\n\n\nData\n4 pts\n\n\nProposal\n4 pts\n\n\nTeamwork\n2 pt\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate\nThis is a draft of the introduction section of your project as well as a data analysis plan and your dataset. Place your writing in an RMarkdown document in your update folder in your project repository.\n\nSection 1 - Introduction: The introduction should introduce your general research question and your data (where it came from, how it was collected,what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).\nSection 2 - Data: Place your data in the `/data` folder, and add dimensions and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of glimpse() or skim() of your data frame.\nSection 3 - Data analysis plan:\n\nThe outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.\nThe comparison groups you will use, if applicable.\nVery exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.\nThe method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s).\nWhat results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?\n\n\nEach section should be no more than 1 page (excluding figures). You can check a print preview to confirm length.\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n20 pts\n\n\n\n\nCleaned Data\n2 pts\n\n\nPreliminary Paper\n10 pts\n\n\nWorkflow, organization, code quality\n3 pts\n\n\nTeamwork\n5 pts\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper\nThis is should include a complete group presentation, paper, and documentation of your analysis.\n\n1. Title\nGive an informative title to your project.\nAssessment: Does the title give an accurate preview of what the paper is about? Is it informative, specific and precise?\n\n\n2. Abstract\nThe abstract provides a brief summary of the entire paper (background, methods, results and conclusions). The suggested length is no more than 150 words. This allows you approximately 1 sentence (and likely no more than two sentences) summarizing each of the following sections. Typically, abstracts are the last thing you write.\nAssessment: Are the main points of the paper described clearly and succinctly?\n\n\n3. Background and significance\nIn this section you are providing the background of the research area and arguing why it is interesting and significant. This section relies heavily on literature review (prior research done in this area and facts that argue why the research is important). This whole section should provide the necessary background leading up to a presentation (in the last few sentences of this section) of the research hypotheses that you will be testing in your study. Well-accepted facts and/or referenced statements should serve as the majority of content of this section. Typically, the background and significance section starts very broad and moves towards the specific area/hypotheses you are testing.\nAssessment: - Does the background and significance have a logical organization? Does it move from the general to the specific? - Has sufficient background been provided to understand the paper? How does this work relate to other work in the scientific literature? - Has a reasonable explanation been given for why the research was done? Why is the work important? Why is it relevant? - Does this section end with statements about the hypothesis/goals of the paper?\n\n\n4. Methods\n\nData collection. Explain how the data was collected/experiment was conducted. Additionally, you should provide information on the individuals who participated to assess representativeness. Non-response rates and other relevant data collection details should be mentioned here if they are an issue. However, you should not discuss the impact of these issues here—save that for the limitations section.\nVariable creation. Detail the variables in your analysis and how they are defined (if necessary). For example, if you created a combined (frequency times quantity) drinking variable you should describe how. If you are talking about gender no further explanation is really needed.\nAnalytic Methods. Explain the statistical procedures that will be used to analyze your data. E.g. Boxplots are used to illustrate differences in GPA across gender and class standing. Correlations are used to assess the impacts of gender and class standing on GPA.\n\nAssessment: Could the study be repeated based on the information given here? Is the material organized into logical categories (like the one’s above)?\n\n\n5. Results\nTypically, results sections start with descriptive statistics, e.g. what percent of the sample is male/female, what is the mean GPA overall, in the different groups, etc. Figures can be nice to illustrate these differences! However, information presented must be relevant in helping to answer the research question(s) of interest. Typically, inferential (i.e. hypothesis tests) statistics come next. Tables can often be helpful for results from multiple regression. Do not give computer output here! This should look like a peer-reviewed journal article results section. Tables and figures should be labeled, embedded in the text, and referenced appropriately. The results section typically makes for fairly dry reading. It does not explain the impact of findings, it merely highlights and reports statistical information.\nAssessment: - Is the content appropriate for a results section? Is there a clear description of the results? - Are the results/data analyzed well? Given the data in each figure/table is the interpretation accurate and logical? Is the analysis of the data thorough (anything ignored?) - Are the figures/tables appropriate for the data being discussed? Are the figure legends and titles clear and concise?\n\n\n6. Discussion/Conclusions\nRestate your objective and draw connections between your analyses and objective. In other words, how did (or didn’t) you answer/address your objective. Place these all in the larger scope of previous research on your topic (i.e. what you found from the literature review), that is, how do your findings help the field move forward? Talk about the limitations of your findings and possible areas for future research to better investigate your research question. End with a concluding sentence or two that summarizes your key findings and impact on the field.\nAssessment: - Does the author clearly state whether the results answer the question (support or disprove the hypothesis)? - Were specific data cited from the results to support each interpretation? Does the author clearly articulate the basis for supporting or rejecting each hypothesis? - Does the author adequately relate the results of the current work to previous research?\n\n\n7. References\nAssessment: Are the references appropriate and of adequate quality? Are the references citied properly (both in the text and at the end of the paper)?\nSome additional general criteria that will be used to evaluate: - Description of the data source - Accuracy of data analysis - Accuracy of conclusions and discussion - Overall clarity and presentation - Originality and significance of the study - Writing quality and organization of the paper\nCredit: The Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n75 pts\n\n\n\n\nCleaned Data\n5 pts\n\n\nPaper\n20 pts\n\n\nWorkflow, organization, code quality\n10 pt\n\n\nTeamwork and Presentation\n5 pt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation or Poster\n3 minutes, per person, maximum, and each team member should say something substantial. You can either present live during class with either a poster, virtual poster, or presentation or pre-record and submit your video to be played during class.\n\nSlide Option\nPrepare a slide deck using the template in your repo. This template uses a package called xaringan, and allows you to make presentation slides using R Markdown syntax. There isn’t a limit to how many slides you can use, just a time limit (3 minutes, per person, total). Each team member should get a chance to speak during the presentation.\nBefore you finalize your presentation, make sure your chunks are turned off with echo = FALSE.\n\n\nVirtual Poster\nSee website supplementary documents for a template.\n\n\nPoster (you need to get this printed)\nSee website supplementary documents for a template.\nWhichever form you choose, your presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried (“then we did this, then we did this, etc.”), instead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.\nPresentations will take place during the last day of class.\nDuring class you will watch presentations from other teams in class and provide feedback in the form of peer evaluations. See website supplementary documents. The presentation line-up will be in group number order (since that was random).\nThe professors grading scheme for the presentation is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n45 pts\n\n\n\n\nTime management: Did the team divide the time well among themselves or got cut off going over time?\n4 pts\n\n\nContent: Is the research question well designed and is the data being used relevant to the research question?\n5 pts\n\n\nProfessionalism: How well did the team present? Does the presentation appear to be well practiced? Did everyone get a chance to say something meaningful about the project?\n5 pts\n\n\nTeamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like independent pieces of work patched together?\n6 pts\n\n\nContent: Did the team use impact visualizations and/or appropriate statistical procedures, and interpret the results accurately?\n10 pts\n\n\nCreativity and Critical Thought: Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n8 pts\n\n\nAre the slides/poster well organized, readable, not full of text, featuring figures with legible labels, legends, etc.?\n7 pts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive summary\nAlong with your visual presentation, your team should provide a brief summary of your project in the README of your repository.\nThis executive summary should provide information on the dataset you’re using, your research question(s), your methodology, and your findings.Place your writing in an RMarkdown document in your executive_summary folder in your project repository.\nThe executive summary and repo organization is worth 30 points and will be evaluated based on whether it follows guidance and whether it’s concise but detailed enough.\n\n\nRepo organization\nThe following folders and files in your project repository:\n\nREADME.Rmd + README.md: Will contain your executive summary and links to your other content.\n/data: Your dataset in CSV or RDS format and your data dictionary\n/proposal: Your project proposal\n/update: Your first major update files\n/paper: Your paper\n/extra: Extra files you may use\n/presentation+ presentation.Rmd + presentation.html: Your presentation slides\n\nStyle and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted."

This course supports the Educational Priorities and Outcomes of Cornell College with emphasis on knowledge, inquiry, reasoning, and communication, ethical behavior, citizenship, and vocation. Your emphasis on knowledge is in the skills you will learn and apply in various interdisciplinary fields. You will inquire when investigating data – seeing patters or trends and exploring them to. Your reasoning skills are built and tested when making decisions based on the data and your own programmed visualizations and numerical summaries. Your group work in class and group project presentations will help you practice your communication of statistical analysis. When you make decisions about what data to work with, how to treat the data, and how to talk about your results in an ethical way you practice good ethical behavior. Some of our analysis’ will be with data from institutions such as governments or organizations that have an influence on the public – these types of analysis’ can inform public policies and are our way, as data scientists, to practice citizenship. Lastly, you will learn about the field of data science and the types of knowledge and training that would be required to support your vocation as a data scientist."

However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section.\nInspect the document outline to review your headers and sub-headers.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(y = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg %>%\n  count(manufacturer) %>%\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), x = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %>%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

This report compiled by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains an image very similar to the one given below.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start by loading the data used to create this plot.\n\nstaff <- read_csv(\"data/instructional-staff.csv\")\n\nEach row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the years for which we have data. The values are percentage of hires of that type of faculty for each year.\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 12\n  facult…¹ `1975` `1989` `1993` `1995` `1999` `2001` `2003` `2005` `2007` `2009`\n  <chr>     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 Full-Ti…   29     27.6   25     24.8   21.8   20.3   19.3   17.8   17.2   16.8\n2 Full-Ti…   16.1   11.4   10.2    9.6    8.9    9.2    8.8    8.2    8      7.6\n3 Full-Ti…   10.3   14.1   13.6   13.6   15.2   15.5   15     14.8   14.9   15.1\n4 Part-Ti…   24     30.4   33.1   33.2   35.5   36     37     39.3   40.5   41.1\n5 Graduat…   20.5   16.5   18.1   18.8   18.7   19     20     19.9   19.5   19.4\n# … with 1 more variable: `2011` <dbl>, and abbreviated variable name\n#   ¹​faculty_type\n\n\nIn order to recreate this visualization we need to first reshape the data to have one variable for faculty type and one variable for year. In other words, we will convert the data from wide format to long format.\nBut before we do so, a thought exercise: How many rows will the long-format data have? It will have a row for each combination of year and faculty type. If there are 5 faculty types and 11 years of data, how many rows will we have?\nWe do the wide to long conversion using a new function: pivot_longer(). The animation below show how this function works, as well as its counterpart pivot_wider().\n\n\n\n\n\nThe function has the following arguments:\n\npivot_longer(data, cols, names_to = \"name\")\n\n\nThe first argument is data as usual.\nThe second argument, cols, is where you specify which columns to pivot into longer format – in this case all columns except for the faculty_type\nThe third argument, names_to, is a string specifying the name of the column to create from the data stored in the column names of data – in this case year\n\n\nstaff_long <- staff %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = \"year\") %>%\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))\n\nLet’s take a look at what the new longer data frame looks like.\n\nstaff_long\n\n# A tibble: 55 × 3\n   faculty_type               year value\n   <chr>                     <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1975  29  \n 2 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1989  27.6\n 3 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1993  25  \n 4 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1995  24.8\n 5 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  1999  21.8\n 6 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2001  20.3\n 7 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2003  19.3\n 8 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2005  17.8\n 9 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2007  17.2\n10 Full-Time Tenured Faculty  2009  16.8\n# … with 45 more rows\n\n\nAnd now let’s plot is as a line plot. A possible approach for creating a line plot where we color the lines by faculty type is the following:\n\nstaff_long %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = faculty_type)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\nBut note that this results in a message as well as an unexpected plot. The message is saying that there is only one observation for each faculty type year combination. We can fix this using the group aesthetic following.\n\nstaff_long %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, group = faculty_type, color = faculty_type)) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude the line plot you made above in your report and make sure the figure width is large enough to make it legible. Also fix the title, axis labels, and legend label.\nSuppose the objective of this plot was to show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types. What changes would you propose making to this plot to tell this story and why.\nImplement the changes you proposed in the previous exercise.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards."

    "text": "Have you ever taken a road trip in the US and thought to yourself “I wonder what La Quinta means”. Well, the late comedian Mitch Hedberg thinks it’s Spanish for next to Denny’s.\nIf you’re not familiar with these two establishments, Denny’s is a casual diner chain that is open 24 hours and La Quinta Inn and Suites is a hotel chain.\nThese two establishments tend to be clustered together, or at least this observation is a joke made famous by Mitch Hedberg. In this lab we explore the validity of this joke and along the way learn some more data wrangling and tips for visualizing spatial data.\nThe inspiration for this lab comes from a blog post by John Reiser on his new jersey geographer blog. You can read that analysis here. Reiser’s blog post focuses on scraping data from Denny’s and La Quinta Inn and Suites websites using Python. In this lab we focus on visualization and analysis of these data. However note that the data scraping was also done in R, and we we will discuss web scraping using R later in the course. But for now we focus on the data that has already been scraped and tidied for you."

It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\nYAML\nOpen the R Markdown (Rmd) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and knit the document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nGo to the Git pane in your RStudio (top right) and click on Commit. This will bring up a new menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have made changes to your Rmd file (which you just changed your name), you should see it list on of the left. Diff shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state that includes your changes. Look over the files in the box that say they have been change. If agree with these changes, you will need to check the box to the left of each changed file, and in this case, write “Update author name” in the Commit message box. Then click Commit. It is important that you always describe what changes were made since your last commit in that box. This is how people in your team know what you changed without having to review thousands of lines of code.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, this would get quite cumbersome. You should consider committing states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration. In the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the block progresses we will let you make these decisions. Committing does not save your progress to the web.\n\n\nPushing changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to the web! Or more specifically, to your repo on GitHub. Why? So that others can see your changes. And by others, we mean whoever you are working with.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, click on Push. This will prompt a dialogue box where you first need to enter your user name, and then your password, then your PAT. This might feel cumbersome. Bear with me… We will teach you how to save your password so you don’t have to enter it every time. But for this one assignment you’ll have to manually enter each time you push in order to gain some experience with it."

    "text": "Many college courses conclude by giving students the opportunity to evaluate the course and the instructor anonymously. However, the use of these student evaluations as an indicator of course quality and teaching effectiveness is often criticized because these measures may reflect the influence of non-teaching related characteristics, such as the physical appearance of the instructor. The article titled, “Beauty in the classroom: instructors’ pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity” (Hamermesh and Parker, 2005) found that instructors who are viewed to be better looking receive higher instructional ratings. (Daniel S. Hamermesh, Amy Parker, Beauty in the classroom: instructors pulchritude and putative pedagogical productivity, Economics of Education Review, Volume 24, Issue 4, August 2005, Pages 369-376, ISSN 0272-7757, 10.1016/j.econedurev.2004.07.013. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775704001165.)\nIn this lab you will analyze the data from this study in order to learn what goes into a positive professor evaluation.\nThe data were gathered from end of semester student evaluations for a large sample of professors from the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, six students rated the professors’ physical appearance. (This is a slightly modified version of the original data set that was released as part of the replication data for Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Gelman and Hill, 2007).) The result is a data frame where each row contains a different course and columns represent variables about the courses and professors."

    "text": "Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes\n… says the Buzzfeed article. Let’s see if that’s true.\nFirst, we’ll create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize. We’ll use the mutate() function for this. The following pipeline mutates the nobel_living data frame by adding a new variable called country_us. We use an if statement to create this variable. The first argument in the if_else() function we’re using to write this if statement is the condition we’re testing for. If country is equal to \"USA\", we set country_us to \"USA\". If not, we set the country_us to \"Other\".\n\nNote that we can achieve the same result using the `fct_other()` function we've seen before (i.e. with `country_us = fct_other(country, \"USA\")`). We decided to use the `if_else()` here to show you one example of an if statement in R.\n\n\nnobel_living <- nobel_living %>%\n  mutate(\n    country_us = if_else(country == \"USA\", \"USA\", \"Other\")\n  )\n\nNext, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.\n\nnobel_living_science <- nobel_living %>%\n  filter(category %in% c(\"Physics\", \"Medicine\", \"Chemistry\", \"Economics\"))\n\nFor the next exercise work with the nobel_living_science data frame you created above. This means you’ll need to define this data frame in your R Markdown document, even though the next exercise doesn’t explicitly ask you to do so.\n\nCreate a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the nobel prize. Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed headline is supported by the data.\n\nYour visualization should be faceted by category.\nFor each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\nFlip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical.\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

Remember that the first argument is passed in from the pipeline, so you just need to define the pattern and replacement arguments.\n\nClick on one of art piece titles in your browser and take note of the url of the webpage it takes you to. Think about how that url compares to what we scraped above? How is it different? Using str_replace(), fix the URLs. You’ll note something special happening in the pattern to replace. We want to replace the ., but we have it as \\\\.. This is because the period . is a special character and so we need to escape it first with backslashes, \\\\s.\n\n\n\nArtists\n\nFill in the blanks to scrape artist names.\n\n\n\nPut it altogether\n\nFill in the blanks to organize everything in a tibble.\n\n\n\nScrape the next page\n\nClick on the next page, and grab its url.

    "text": "Iteration\n\nWork in scripts/03-scrape-page-many.R.\n\nWe went from manually scraping individual pages to writing a function to do the same. Next, we will work on making our workflow a little more efficient by using R to iterate over all pages that contain information on the art collection.\n\n**Reminder:** The collection has 2970 pieces in total.\n\nThat means we give develop a list of URLs (of pages that each have 10 art pieces), and write some code that applies the scrape_page() function to each page, and combines the resulting data frames from each page into a single data frame with 2970 rows and 3 columns.\n\nList of URLs\nClick through the first few of the pages in the art collection and observe their URLs to confirm the following pattern:\n[sometext]offset=0     # Pieces 1-10\n[sometext]offset=10    # Pieces 11-20\n[sometext]offset=20    # Pieces 21-30\n[sometext]offset=30    # Pieces 31-40\n...\n[sometext]offset=2960  # Pieces 2961-2970\nWe can construct these URLs in R by pasting together two pieces: (1) a common (root) text for the beginning of the URL, and (2) numbers starting at 0, increasing by 10, all the way up to 2970. Two new functions are helpful for accomplishing this: glue() for pasting two pieces of text and seq() for generating a sequence of numbers.\n\nFill in the blanks to construct the list of URLs.\n\n\n\nMapping\nFinally, we’re ready to iterate over the list of URLs we constructed. We will do this by mapping the function we developed over the list of URLs. There are a series of mapping functions in R (which we’ll learn about in more detail tomorrow), and they each take the following form:\nmap([x], [function to apply to each element of x])\nIn our case x is the list of URLs we constructed and the function to apply to each element of x is the function we developed earlier, scrape_page. And as a result we want a data frame, so we use map_dfr function:\n\nmap_dfr(urls, scrape_page)\n\n\nFill in the blanks to scrape all pages, and to create a new data frame called uoe_art.\n\n\n\nWrite out data\n\nFinally write out the data frame you constructed into the data folder so that you can use it in the analysis section.\n\n✅ ⬆️ If you haven’t done so recently, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

RMD - you are saving the script file and moving to another file.\n\nNow that we have a tidy dataset that we can analyze, let’s do that!\nWe’ll start with some data cleaning, to clean up the dates that appear at the end of some title text in parentheses. Some of these are years, others are more specific dates, some art pieces have no date information whatsoever, and others have some non-date information in parentheses. This should be interesting to clean up!\nFirst thing we’ll try is to separate the title column into two: one for the actual title and the other for the date if it exists. In human speak, we need to\n\n“separate the title column at the first occurrence of ( and put the contents on one side of the ( into a column called title and the contents on the other side into a column called date”\n\nLuckily, there’s a function that does just this: separate()!\nAnd once we have completed separating the single title column into title and date, we need to do further clean-up in the date column to get rid of extraneous )s with str_remove(), capture year information, and save the data as a numeric variable.\nHint: Remember escaping special characters from yesterday’s lecture? You’ll need to use that trick again.\n\nFill in the blanks in to implement the data wrangling we described above. Note that this will result in some warnings when you run the code, and that’s OK! Read the warnings, and explain what they mean, and why we are ok with leaving them in given that our objective is to just capture year where it’s convenient to do so.\nPrint out a summary of the data frame using the skim() function. How many pieces have artist info missing? How many have year info missing?\nMake a histogram of years. Use a reasonable binwidth. Do you see anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\n**Hint:** You'll want to use `mutate()` and `if_else()` or `case_when()` to implement the correction.\n\n\nFind which piece has the out of the ordinary year and go to its page on the art collection website to find the correct year for it. Can you tell why our code didn’t capture the correct year information? Correct the error in the data frame and visualize the data again.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ If you haven’t done so recently, knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.\n\nWho is the most commonly featured artist in the collection? Do you know them? Any guess as to why the university has so many pieces from them?\n\nHint: str_subset() can be helful here. You should consider how you might capture titles where the word appears as “child” and “Child”.\n\nFinal question! How many art pieces have the word “child” in their title? Try to figure it out, and ask for help if you’re stuck.\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards and review the md document on GitHub to make sure you’re happy with the final state of your work."

Are there any surprising results?\nNote: Don’t forget to label your R chunk as well (where it says label-me-1). Your label should be short, informative, and shouldn’t include spaces.

Which type of hotel is higher, on average?\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style\n\n\n\nExercise 8.\nWe observe two unusual values in the summary statistics above – a negative minimum, and a very high maximum). What types of hotels are these? Locate these observations in the dataset and find out the arrival date (year and month) as well as how many people (adults, children, and babies) stayed in the room. You can investigate the data in the viewer to locate these values, but preferably you should identify them in a reproducible way with some code.\nHint: For example, you can filter for the given adr amounts and select the relevant columns.\n\n# add code here\n# pay attention to correctness and code style"

How are the months ordered? What would be a better order? Then, reorder the months on the x-axis (levels of arrival_date_month) in a way that makes more sense. You will want to use a function from the forcats package, see https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html for inspiration and help.\nStretch goal: If you finish the above task before time is up, change the y-axis label so the values are shown with dollar signs, e.g. $80 instead of 80. You will want to use a function from the scales package, see https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/index.html for inspiration and help.\n\nhotels %>%\n  group_by(hotel, arrival_date_month) %>%   # group by hotel type and arrival month\n  summarise(mean_adr = mean(adr)) %>%       # calculate mean adr for each group\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = arrival_date_month,                 # x-axis = arrival_date_month\n    y = mean_adr,                           # y-axis = mean_adr calculated above\n    group = hotel,                          # group lines by hotel type\n    color = hotel)                          # and color by hotel type\n    ) +\n  geom_line() +                             # use lines to represent data\n  theme_minimal() +                         # use a minimal theme\n  labs(\n    x = \"Arrival month\",                 # customize labels\n    y = \"Mean ADR (average daily rate)\",\n    title = \"Comparison of resort and city hotel prices across months\",\n    subtitle = \"Resort hotel prices soar in the summer while ciry hotel prices remain relatively constant throughout the year\",\n    color = \"Hotel type\"\n    )\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'hotel'.

    "text": "Data\nIn order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset must have at least 50 observations and between 10 to 20 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nIf you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class.\nOn the useful links part of the website you will find a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse. You’re not limited to these resources, and in fact you’re encouraged to venture beyond them."

Place your writing in an RMarkdown document in your proposal folder in your project repository. Your group will also present the data you have found. Together, as a group, we will review your idea and discuss your ideas. Every group member must contribute to this conversation. This also gives me an opportunity to help you decide if the data you have chosen will work for your questions of interest. I will be cloning you a repository to work on your project with. You do not need to copy and paste from this document.\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n10 pts\n\n\n\n\nData\n4 pts\n\n\nProposal\n4 pts\n\n\nTeamwork\n2 pt\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate\nThis is a draft of the introduction section of your project as well as a data analysis plan and your dataset. Place your writing in an RMarkdown document in your update folder in your project repository.\n\nSection 1 - Introduction: The introduction should introduce your general research question and your data (where it came from, how it was collected,what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.).\nSection 2 - Data: Place your data in the `/data` folder, and add dimensions and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of and codebook to the README in that folder. Then print out the output of glimpse() or skim() of your data frame.\nSection 3 - Data analysis plan:\n\nThe outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.\nThe comparison groups you will use, if applicable.\nVery exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.\nThe method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s).\nWhat results from these specific statistical methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?\n\n\nEach section should be no more than 1 page (excluding figures). You can check a print preview to confirm length.\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n20 pts\n\n\n\n\nCleaned Data\n2 pts\n\n\nPreliminary Paper\n10 pts\n\n\nWorkflow, organization, code quality\n3 pt\n\n\nTeamwork\n5 pt\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper\nThis is should include a complete group presentation, paper, and documentation of your analysis.\n\n1. Title\nGive an informative title to your project.\nAssessment: Does the title give an accurate preview of what the paper is about? Is it informative, specific and precise?\n\n\n2. Abstract\nThe abstract provides a brief summary of the entire paper (background, methods, results and conclusions). The suggested length is no more than 150 words. This allows you approximately 1 sentence (and likely no more than two sentences) summarizing each of the following sections. Typically, abstracts are the last thing you write.\nAssessment: Are the main points of the paper described clearly and succinctly?\n\n\n3. Background and significance\nIn this section you are providing the background of the research area and arguing why it is interesting and significant. This section relies heavily on literature review (prior research done in this area and facts that argue why the research is important). This whole section should provide the necessary background leading up to a presentation (in the last few sentences of this section) of the research hypotheses that you will be testing in your study. Well-accepted facts and/or referenced statements should serve as the majority of content of this section. Typically, the background and significance section starts very broad and moves towards the specific area/hypotheses you are testing.\nAssessment: - Does the background and significance have a logical organization? Does it move from the general to the specific? - Has sufficient background been provided to understand the paper? How does this work relate to other work in the scientific literature? - Has a reasonable explanation been given for why the research was done? Why is the work important? Why is it relevant? - Does this section end with statements about the hypothesis/goals of the paper?\n\n\n4. Methods\n\nData collection. Explain how the data was collected/experiment was conducted. Additionally, you should provide information on the individuals who participated to assess representativeness. Non-response rates and other relevant data collection details should be mentioned here if they are an issue. However, you should not discuss the impact of these issues here—save that for the limitations section.\nVariable creation. Detail the variables in your analysis and how they are defined (if necessary). For example, if you created a combined (frequency times quantity) drinking variable you should describe how. If you are talking about gender no further explanation is really needed.\nAnalytic Methods. Explain the statistical procedures that will be used to analyze your data. E.g. Boxplots are used to illustrate differences in GPA across gender and class standing. Correlations are used to assess the impacts of gender and class standing on GPA.\n\nAssessment: Could the study be repeated based on the information given here? Is the material organized into logical categories (like the one’s above)?\n\n\n5. Results\nTypically, results sections start with descriptive statistics, e.g. what percent of the sample is male/female, what is the mean GPA overall, in the different groups, etc. Figures can be nice to illustrate these differences! However, information presented must be relevant in helping to answer the research question(s) of interest. Typically, inferential (i.e. hypothesis tests) statistics come next. Tables can often be helpful for results from multiple regression. Do not give computer output here! This should look like a peer-reviewed journal article results section. Tables and figures should be labeled, embedded in the text, and referenced appropriately. The results section typically makes for fairly dry reading. It does not explain the impact of findings, it merely highlights and reports statistical information.\nAssessment: - Is the content appropriate for a results section? Is there a clear description of the results? - Are the results/data analyzed well? Given the data in each figure/table is the interpretation accurate and logical? Is the analysis of the data thorough (anything ignored?) - Are the figures/tables appropriate for the data being discussed? Are the figure legends and titles clear and concise?\n\n\n6. Discussion/Conclusions\nRestate your objective and draw connections between your analyses and objective. In other words, how did (or didn’t) you answer/address your objective. Place these all in the larger scope of previous research on your topic (i.e. what you found from the literature review), that is, how do your findings help the field move forward? Talk about the limitations of your findings and possible areas for future research to better investigate your research question. End with a concluding sentence or two that summarizes your key findings and impact on the field.\nAssessment: - Does the author clearly state whether the results answer the question (support or disprove the hypothesis)? - Were specific data cited from the results to support each interpretation? Does the author clearly articulate the basis for supporting or rejecting each hypothesis? - Does the author adequately relate the results of the current work to previous research?\n\n\n7. References\nAssessment: Are the references appropriate and of adequate quality? Are the references citied properly (both in the text and at the end of the paper)?\nSome additional general criteria that will be used to evaluate: - Description of the data source - Accuracy of data analysis - Accuracy of conclusions and discussion - Overall clarity and presentation - Originality and significance of the study - Writing quality and organization of the paper\nCredit: The Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n75 pts\n\n\n\n\nCleaned Data\n5 pts\n\n\nPaper\n20 pts\n\n\nWorkflow, organization, code quality\n10 pt\n\n\nTeamwork and Presentation\n5 pt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation or Poster\n3 minutes, per person, maximum, and each team member should say something substantial. You can either present live during class with either a poster, virtual poster, or presentation or pre-record and submit your video to be played during class.\n\nSlide Option\nPrepare a slide deck using the template in your repo. This template uses a package called xaringan, and allows you to make presentation slides using R Markdown syntax. There isn’t a limit to how many slides you can use, just a time limit (3 minutes, per person, total). Each team member should get a chance to speak during the presentation.\nBefore you finalize your presentation, make sure your chunks are turned off with echo = FALSE.\n\n\nVirtual Poster\nSee website supplementary documents for a template.\n\n\nPoster (you need to get this printed)\nSee website supplementary documents for a template.\nWhichever form you choose, your presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried (“then we did this, then we did this, etc.”), instead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.\nPresentations will take place during the last day of class.\nDuring class you will watch presentations from other teams in class and provide feedback in the form of peer evaluations. See website supplementary documents. The presentation line-up will be in group number order (since that was random).\nThe professors grading scheme for the presentation is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal | 45 pts | ================================================================================================================================================================================================================+========+ Time management: Did the team divide the time well among themselves or got cut off going over time? | 4 pts |\n\n\nContent: Is the research question well designed and is the data being used relevant to the research question?\n5 pts\n\n\n\nProfessionalism: How well did the team present? Does the presentation appear to be well practiced? Did everyone get a chance to say something meaningful about the project?\n5 pts\n\n\n\nTeamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like independent pieces of work patched together?\n6 pts\n\n\n\nContent: Did the team use impact visualizations and/or appropriate statistical procedures, and interpret the results accurately? | 10 pts\n\n\nCreativity and Critical Thought: Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?\n8 pts |\n\n\nAre the slides/poster well organized, readable, not full of text, featuring figures with legible labels, legends, etc.? | 7 pts |\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive summary\nAlong with your visual presentation, your team should provide a brief summary of your project in the README of your repository.\nThis executive summary should provide information on the dataset you’re using, your research question(s), your methodology, and your findings.Place your writing in an RMarkdown document in your executive_summary folder in your project repository.\nThe executive summary and repo organization is worth 30 points and will be evaluated based on whether it follows guidance and whether it’s concise but detailed enough.\n\n\nRepo organization\nThe following folders and files in your project repository:\n\nREADME.Rmd + README.md: Will contain your executive summary and links to your other content.\n/data: Your dataset in CSV or RDS format and your data dictionary\n/proposal: Your project proposal\n/update: Your first major update files\n/paper: Your paper\n/extra: Extra files you may use\n/presentation+ presentation.Rmd + presentation.html: Your presentation slides\n\nStyle and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted."

All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and team evaluations will be given at its completion - anyone judged, by their teammates, to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in the assignment works. GitHub shows who submits changes and can also be used to see who participated. You will be asked to fill out a survey where you report a contribution percentage for each team member. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than 20% of the work, please provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that they did less than 10% of the work, this person will receive half the grade of the rest of the group.\n\n\nLate work policy\n\nThere is no late submission / make up for the presentation. You must be in class on the day of the presentation to get credit for it or pre-record and submit your presentation by 9am in the morning of the presentations."

    "text": "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\nA percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: Wikipedia\nThere are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: p25th, median, and p75th. These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.\n\nWhy do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?\n\nThe question we want to answer “How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?”. We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by major_category. Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups. This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions. So first, we need to visualize the data.\nWe use the ggplot() function to do this. The first argument is the data frame, and the next argument gives the mapping of the variables of the data to the aesthetic elements of the plot.\nLet’s start simple and take a look at the distribution of all median incomes, without considering the major categories.\n\nggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\nAlong with the plot, we get a message:\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\nThis is telling us that we might want to reconsider the binwidth we chose for our histogram – or more accurately, the binwidth we didn’t specify. It’s good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth. You might ask yourself: “What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?” $1 is obviously too little, $10000 might be too high.\n\nTry binwidths of $1000 and $5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the geom_histogram function. So to specify a binwidth of $1000, you would use geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000).\n\nWe can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the summarise function:\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),\n            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),\n            sd = sd(median), \n            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),\n            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))\n\n\nBased on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution. Write up your description (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram, faceted by major_category. Use the binwidth you chose in the earlier exercise.\n\nNow that we’ve seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.\n\nWhich major category has the highest typical (you’ll need to decide what this means) median income? Use the partial code below, filling it in with the appropriate statistic and function. Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure to arrange in the correct direction.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  group_by(major_category) %>%\n  summarise(___ = ___(median)) %>%\n  arrange(___)\n\n\nWhich major category is the least popular in this sample? To answer this question we use a new function called count, which first groups the data and then counts the number of observations in each category (see below). Add to the pipeline appropriately to arrange the results so that the major with the lowest observations is on top.\n\n\ncollege_recent_grads %>%\n  count(major_category)\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.\nSource: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bike Sharing Dataset"

    "text": "Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash\nEvery election cycle brings its own brand of excitement – and lots of money. Political donations are of particular interest to political scientists and other researchers studying politics and voting patterns. They are also of interest to citizens who want to stay informed of how much money their candidates raise and where that money comes from.\nIn the United States, “only American citizens (and immigrants with green cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees.”1\nIn this assignment we will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. First, we will get data foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle. Then, you will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.\nIn order to complete this assignment you will need a Chrome browser with the Selector Gadget extension installed."

    "text": "Data collection via web scraping\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data come from OpenSecrets.org, a “website tracking the influence of money on U.S. politics, and how that money affects policy and citizens’ lives”. This website is hosted by The Center for Responsive Politics, which is a nonpartisan, independent nonprofit that “tracks money in U.S. politics and its effect on elections and public policy.”2\nBefore getting started, let’s check that a bot has permissions to access pages on this domain.\n\nlibrary(robotstxt)\npaths_allowed(\"https://www.opensecrets.org\")\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nOur goal is to scrape data from https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2022) on contributions in all election years Open Secrets has data for. Since that means repeating a task many times, let’s first write a function that works on the first page. Confirm it works on a few others. Then iterate it over pages for all years.\n\nComplete the following set of steps in the scrape-pac.R file in the scripts folder of your repository. This file already contains some starter code to help you out.\n\n\nWrite a function called scrape_pac() that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign-connected PAC contributions in a given year. This function should\n\nhave one input: the URL of the webpage and should return a data frame.\nrename variables scraped, using snake_case naming.\nclean up the Country of Origin/Parent Company variable with str_squish().\nadd a new column to the data frame for year. We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn’t take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the str_sub() function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify “last 4 characters”.\n\nDefine the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions. Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?\nConstruct a vector called urls that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year.\nMap the scrape_pac() function over urls in a way that will result in a data frame called pac_all.\nWrite the data frame to a csv file called pac-all.csv in the data folder.\n\n✅⬆️ If you haven’t yet done so, now is definitely a good time to commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message (e.g. “Data scraping complete”). Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.\n\nComplete the following set of steps in the hw-06.Rmd file in your repository.\n\n\nIn your R Markdown file, load pac-all.csv and report its number of observations and variables using inline code."

    "text": "Data cleaning\nIn this section we clean the pac_all data frame to prepare it for analysis and visualization. We have two goals in data cleaning:\n\nSeparate the country_parent into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.\nConvert contribution amounts in total, dems, and repubs from character strings to numeric values.\n\nThe following exercises walk you through how to make these fixes to the data.\n\nUse the separate() function to separate country_parent into country and parent columns. Note that country and parent company names are separated by \\ (which will need to be specified in your function) and also note that there are some entries where the \\ sign appears twice and in these cases we want to only split the value at the first occurrence of \\. This can be accomplished by setting the extra argument in to \"merge\" so that the cell is split into only 2 segments, e.g. we want \"Denmark/Novo Nordisk A/S\" to be split into \"Denmark\" and \"Novo Nordisk A/S\". (See help for separate() for more on this.) End your code chunk by printing out the top 10 rows of your data frame (if you just type the data frame name it should automatically do this for you).\nRemove the character strings including $ and , signs in the total, dems,and repubs columns and convert these columns to numeric. End your code chunk by printing out the top 10 rows of your data frame (if you just type the data frame name it should automatically do this for you). A couple hints to help you out:\n\nThe $ character is a special character so it will need to be escaped.\nSome contribution amounts are in the millions (e.g. Anheuser-Busch contributed a total of $1,510,897 in 2008). In this case we need to remove all occurrences of ,, which we can do by using str_remove_all() instead of str_remove().\n\n\n🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Now is a good time to knit your document, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.

    "text": "If the status shows something other than Operational, this means there is a known incident with the containers. Check back later to see if it’s been resolved. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the course forum to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).\nEither way you can also fill out the form here, which will notify our the R TA for the department as well as our undergraduate coordinator. They’ll be able to help diagnose the issue."
