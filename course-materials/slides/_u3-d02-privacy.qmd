# Case study: OK Cupid

## OK Cupid data breach {.smaller}

- In 2016, researchers published data of 70,000 OkCupid users—including usernames, political leanings, drug usage, and intimate sexual details

- Researchers didn't release the real names and pictures of OKCupid users, but their identities could easily be uncovered from the details provided, e.g. usernames

>Some may object to the ethics of gathering and releasing this data. However, all the data found in the dataset are or were already publicly available, so releasing this dataset merely presents it in a more useful form. 
>
>Researchers Emil Kirkegaard and Julius Daugbjerg Bjerrekær

### In analysis of data that individuals willingly shared publicly on a given platform (e.g. social media), how do you make sure you don't violate reasonable expectations of privacy?
